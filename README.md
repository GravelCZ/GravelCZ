# Hi, I am GravelCZ

#### I'm a human from Czechia

- I'm mostly working with Java but I don't mind using C for some applications.
- #linuxmasterrace
- I use arch BTW

## My projects
### Discontinued / Deleted / Useless
- TracerBlocker - A Plugin written for Spigot that prevented cheaters from using.. well.. tracers, hence the name. The code was forked, not optimised and not that good so I deleted the repository. I might revisit this one with fresh code and a bit of ✨ MATH ✨
- FarmBot - A really interesting project that was supposed to be a minecraft bot that could run multiple instances. It could navigate, mine, fight, farm and many other things. But due to lack of knowledge it basically isn't working at all. Also smarter people then me made [baritone](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone)
- Breakpoint - An fun minigame server plugin. An all-in-one plugin kinda. The main gamemode was CTF but nobody would play this today sooo... crap. Brings back old memories tho.

### So.. something working?
YES!
- RemoteClassLoader - A piece of code that is able to load a .jar file from an URL and run it at runtime. Amazing when you want to hide a piece of your work. Don't use it for evil tho.

### What do you use?
- Java - Eclipse, swited to IntellIJ IDEA, not sure I like it
- C, PHP, JS, HTML, CSS - VScodium

### How can I contact you?
DON'T! PLEASE LEAVE ME ALONE!!!!<br>
But since you insist so much [here](https://gravelos.cz) is my website<br>
And gravelcz@gravelos.cz is my email.<br>
I won't link my other accounts here. You are here for my code right? Right?
